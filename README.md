============

An API compatible open source server for interacting with devices speaking the [spark-protocol](https://github.com/spark/spark-protocol)

Quick Install
==============

```
git clone https://github.com/spark/spark-server.git
cd spark-server/
npm install
node main.js
```

[Raspberry pi Quick Install](doc/raspberryPi.md)


How do I get started?
=====================

1) Run the server with:

```
node main.js
```

2) Watch for your IP address, you'll see something like:

```
Your server IP address is: 192.168.1.10
```

3) We will now create a new server profile on Particle-CLI using the command:

```
particle config profile_name apiUrl "http://DOMAIN_OR_IP"
```

For the local cloud, the port number 8080 needs to be added behind: `http://domain_or_ip:8080`.  It is important to also have the `http://` otherwise it won't work.

This will create a new profile to point to your server and switching back to the spark cloud is simply `particle config particle` and other profiles would be `particle config profile_name`

4) We will now point over to the local cloud using 
```
particle config profile_name
```

5) On a separate CMD from the one running the server, type

```
particle setup
```

This will create an account on the local cloud

Perform CTRL + C once you logon with Particle-CLI asking you to send Wifi-credentials etc...

6) Put your core into listening mode, and run `spark identify` to get your core id. You'll need this id later

7) `mkdir ..\temp` and `cd ..\temp` - A bunch of keys will be generated in the next steps.

8) Change server keys to local cloud key + IP Address

```
particle keys server ..\spark-server\default_key.pub.pem IP_ADDRESS
```

9) Create and provision access on your local cloud with the keys doctor:

```
   particle keys doctor your_core_id
```


What kind of project is this?
======================================

We're open sourcing our core Spark-protocol code to help you build awesome stuff with your Spark Core, and with your
other projects.  We're also open sourcing an example server with the same easy to use Rest API as the Spark Cloud, so
your local apps can easily run against both the Spark Cloud, and your local cloud.  We're really excited about this,
and we have tried to build an open, stable, and powerful platform, and hand it over to you, the community.

This project is our way of making sure you can change and see into every aspect of your Spark Core, yay!
We'll keep improving and adding features, and we hope you'll want to join in too!


What features are currently present
====================================

The spark-server module aims to provide a HTTP rest interface that is API compatible with the main Spark Cloud.  Ideally any
programs you write to run against the Spark Cloud should also work on the Local Cloud.  Some features aren't here yet, but may be
coming down the road, right now the endpoints exposed are:

List devices

`GET /v1/devices`

Call function

`POST /v1/devices/:coreid/:func`

Get variable

`GET /v1/devices/:coreid/:var`

Get Core attributes

`GET /v1/devices/:coreid`

Set Core attributes (and flash a core)

`PUT /v1/devices/:coreid`

Get all Events

```
 GET /v1/events
 GET /v1/events/:event_name
```



Get all my Events

```
 GET /v1/devices/events
 GET /v1/devices/events/:event_name
```

Get all my Core's Events

```
 GET /v1/devices/:coreid/events
 GET /v1/devices/:coreid/events/:event_name
```

Publish an event

`POST /v1/devices/events`

What features will be added soon?
====================================

- Release a Core
    DELETE /v1/devices/:coreid

- Claim a core
    POST /v1/devices

- per-user / per-core ownership and access restrictions.  Right now ANY user on your local cloud can access ANY device.

- remote compiling, however flashing a binary will still work


What API features are missing
================================

  - the build IDE is not part of this release, but may be released separately later
  - massive enterprise magic super horizontal scaling powers


Known Limitations
==================

We worked hard to make our cloud services scalable and awesome, but that also presents a burden for new users.  This release was designed to be easy to use, to understand, and to maintain, and not to discourage anyone who is new to running a server.  This means some of the fancy stuff isn't here yet, but don't despair, we'll keep improving this project, and we hope you'll use it to build awesome things.


What features are coming
